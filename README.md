## Overview

KG-CNNDTI is a novel framework that combines knowledge graph representations with convolutional neural networks to predict drug-target interactions. The model leverages structured biological knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy and provide interpretable results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Conda (recommended) or Python 3.8
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for faster training)

### Setup Environment

```bash
conda create -n KGCNNDTI python=3.8
conda activate KGCNNDTI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
